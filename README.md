# Simple-Minimalistic-Academic-Portfolio
A free Simple, Minimalistic, Zen inspired responsive (looks beautiful on all types of devices) Academic Portfolio that can easily be hosted on github pages in 5 minutes.

This is what it looks like: [Live Demo](https://richidubey.github.io/Simple-Minimalistic-Academic-Portfolio/)

## How to set up your own portfolio with this theme
1. Create a new github repository with the name '\<yourusername\>.github.io' with a README file - which would help you to clone it. For example, I would have to create a repository named 'richidubey​​.github.​io'. To find your user name, goto www.github.com and click your user profile in the top right corner of the page.
2. Clone your repository on your machine.
3. Download this repository as zip. Extract the files in the new repository you just created.https://richidubey.github.io/
4. Work on all the TODO tags present in the index.html file (open in code editor) in your repository. This would set up your image, publications, awards, CV on your porfolio and make it truly yours!
5. Commit the changes.
6. You're Done! Open https://\<yourusername\>.github.io/ in your browser.
